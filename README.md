# Prompt Engineering & Spring AI

## Description
This application provides a REST API using Spring AI chat client to fetch information about World Cup winners, Spring Framework versions, and to analyze invoices.

## Importance of Structured Outputs
The ability of LLMs (Large Language Models) to produce structured outputs is critical for developers who need to quickly convert AI-generated results into data types such as JSON, XML, or Java Classes. This capability enables seamless integration with other functions and methods in applications.
